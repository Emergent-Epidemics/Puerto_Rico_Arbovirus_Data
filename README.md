# Puerto Rico Arbovirus Data
We are digitizing the weekly arbovirus reports from the Departamento de Salud in Puerto Rico.  They are originally provided as PDFs.  Please see the original data here  http://www.salud.gov.pr/Estadisticas-Registros-y-Publicaciones/ and here https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/post/5a4fcc3e2c1b1669c22aa261.  It's really critical to point out that we haven't yet performed proper validation on these data and would very much welcome contributors who are either interested in suggesting code changes, validating data, and/or contributing new data sets. In addition, please see the specific license, warranty, and copyright information for our code and each individual data set.

## Informes Arbovirales

Data/Informes_Arbovirales_1532444481.14413-years-2016-2017-2018.csv

### Puerto Rico level data on arboviruses between 2016 - present
#### Description
The first data set we've completed is Informes Arbovirales.  These PDFs report weekly confirmed cases of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika (ZIKV), and filoviruses--along with suspected cases of arboviral diseases--on a weekly basis.  The cumulative columns are the running cumulative for each disease for the year (and it appears as though 2017 includes 2016) and it's possible for the difference in sequential weeks to be negative because cases can be "back corrected" causing a reduction in the total number of cumulative cases.  The "new" columns are the number of new cases reported that week.  However, they are reported as running 3-4 week totals.  The "Group" column contains the weeks one needs to use to generate the new case counts for that week.  We plan on writing code to parse these and organize them, but haven't yet completed that work.

## chikungunya
### Filename
Data/chikungunya_1532458510.44679-years-2014-2015-2016.csv

### Puerto Rico level data on chikungunya data between 2014 - 2015
#### Description
These PDFs report weekly confirmed cases and suspected cases of chikungunya (CHIKV) and confirmed cases of co-infection with dengue (although it appears as though there weren't any and the DoH stopped reporting this field in 2016) on a weekly basis.  The "new" columns are the number of new cases reported that week.  However, they are reported as running 3-4 week totals (expect in 2014 where they were presented weekly).  The "Group" column contains the weeks one needs to use to generate the new case counts for that week.  We plan on writing code to parse these and organize them, but haven't yet completed that work. The PDFs also have running cumulative and reports of CHIKV induced mortality, but we haven't extracted those yet.

## dengue
### Filename
Data/dengue_1532462761.77886-years-2013-2014-2015-2016.csv

### Puerto Rico level data on dengue data between 2013 - 2016
#### Description
There's some issue with many of the PDFs, which are preventing us from opening them programmatically, which we are still investigating.  These PDFs report weekly confirmed cases and suspected cases of dengue (DENV).  The "new" columns are the number of new cases reported that week.  However, in later years they are reported as running 3-4 week totals.  The "Group" column contains the weeks one needs to use to generate the new case counts for that week.  We plan on writing code to parse these and organize them, but haven't yet completed that work. The PDFs also have running cumulative and reports of DENV by serotype, but we haven't extracted those yet.

## San Juan dengue Data
### Filename
Data/san_juan_dengue_data.csv

### San Juan dengue data for the 1990/1991 to 2012/2013 dengue seasons 
#### Description
See https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/post/5a4fcc3e2c1b1669c22aa261 for more information. Here, we are directly copy/pasting from that website. The dataset contains weekly dengue data for the San Juan-Carolina-Caguas Metropolitan Statistical Area. The dataset includes the following variables: 

* season: the transmission season; 
* season_week: week of the season (not the calendar year - the season starts following the week with historically lowest dengue cases over the years 1990-2009); 
* week_start_date: date of the first day of the week; 
* denv1_cases: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV1; 
* denv2_cases: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV2; 
* denv3_cases: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV3; 
* denv4_cases: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV4; 
* other_positive_cases: laboratory-positive cases without serotype identified (these include acute IgM positive and IgM conversions); 
* additional_cases: at times not all specimens submitted were tested due to overload of the capacity for testing or incomplete case information. For those weeks, the number of additional laboratory-positive cases among those not tested was estimated by multiplying the number of untested cases by the rate of laboratory-positive cases amongst those that were tested; 
* total_cases: the sum of all cases (denv1-4_cases + other_positive_cases + additional_cases), the target time series for forecasting.

Over time, the sensitivity of testing increased, particularly in 2005 when PCR was implemented for routine diagnostics, in 2007 when improved IgM testing was implemented, and in 2009 when a more sensitive PCR assay was adopted. Details are presented in Sharp et al. 2010.
